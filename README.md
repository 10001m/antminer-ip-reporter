- [ ] [Download IP Reporter for Windows/Linux/MacOS](https://github.com/10001m/antminer-ip-reporter/releases/download/ipreporter_win/IP.Reporter.rar)
IP Reporter is an application that helps you find the IP address of your new miner. To use IP Reporter, you need a computer that is on the same network as the miner, with a Microsoft Windows operating system. Note that our IP Reporter only works with Windows, and therefore the PC cannot scan the IP addresses of miners using other operating systems. When your miner is connected to a power source and connected to the same network, download IP Reporter to your PC.

Open an Internet browser on your computer (note: supported browsers are Google Chrome and Firefox) and enter the IP address in the address bar of the browser. The miner interface will appear, and you can log in.

The default entry is the username “root” and the password “root”. If you change the password, you must record the new password in a safe place where you can find it. The miner cannot recover the lost password.

Use this version of IP Reporter if you have problems with the latest version of the utility.
